    <h1>Response:</h1>
    <p class="response">Based on the provided articles, USC and UCLA have a long-standing rivalry across various sports, including football, men's and women's basketball, and water polo.  The rivalry extends beyond sports, as evidenced by the discussion of their rankings in U.S. News & World Report (https://dailybruin.com/2010/08/30/us_newsworld_report_ranks_usc_above_ucla/).  In some instances, USC has been victorious, such as their men's basketball win over UCLA in 2016 (https://dailybruin.com/2016/01/14/ucla-is-conquered-by-usc-75-89/) and their football win over UCLA in 2024, securing bowl eligibility (https://dailybruin.com/2024/11/23/trojans-win/).  However, UCLA has also had wins, such as their men's water polo victory over USC in 2017 (https://dailybruin.com/2017/11/13/crosstown-clash-ucla-mens-water-polo-topples-usc-in-triple-overtime/).  The articles frequently cover game results and analyses of the rivalry.</p>
